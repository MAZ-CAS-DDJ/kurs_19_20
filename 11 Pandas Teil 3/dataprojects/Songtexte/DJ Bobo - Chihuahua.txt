Chihuahua! x4

Oh, chihuahua!

I'm walking in the street
And the moon shines bright
A little melody keeps feeling on my mind tonight
I gotcha!
It's the song about Chihuahua
Yeah, that's cool alright

It was fun
And a life without sorrow
Feels young
And when you think about tomorrow
Say YO!
When you're about to freak out
Just go and then shout it out loud

Chihuahua here
Chihuahua there
Everybody wants it everywhere
Sing it loud
And life can be so easy

What can make you move, Chihuahua
Can you feel the groove Chihuahua
What can make you dance
Oh Chihuahua!
What can make you sing Chihuahua
Take it and you win Chihuahua
What can bring you joy
Oh Chihuahua!

I'm driving in my car
Looking for a parking space
There it is my place someone else wins the race
NO, I give up
Today is not my day
But then I take a deep breathe and say:

Calm down
When you're about to go crazy
Turn around
And feel as fresh as a daisy
Just run
Because it's time to go
Have fun and let the whole world know

Chihuahua here
Chihuahua there
Everybody wants it everywhere
Sing it loud
And life can be so easy Chihuahua

What can make you move Chihuahua
Can you feel the groove Chihuahua
What can make you dance
Oh Chihuahua!
What can make you sing Chihuahua
Take it and you win Chihuahua
What can bring you joy
Oh Chihuahua!

Chihuahua (8x)
Oh Chihuahua!

What can make you move Chihuahua
Can you feel the groove Chihuahua
What can make you dance
Oh Chihuahua!
What can make you shout Chihuahua
What it's all about Chihuahua
What can bring you love
Oh Chihuahua!
