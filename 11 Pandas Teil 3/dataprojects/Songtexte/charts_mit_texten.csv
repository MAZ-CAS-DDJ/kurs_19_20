Hoch am Himmelszelt
Den schenk ich Dir heut' Nacht
Einen Stern, der deinen Namen trägt
Alle Zeiten überlebt
Und über unsere Liebe wacht

Seit Jahren schon leb ich mit Dir
Und ich danke Gott dafür
dass er mir Dich gegeben hat
Als Erinnerung an unser Leben
Möchte ich Dir heut' etwas geben
Ein Geschenk für alle Ewigkeit

Einen Stern, der deinen Namen trägt
Hoch am Himmelszelt
Den schenk ich Dir heut' Nacht
Einen Stern, der deinen Namen trägt
Alle Zeiten überlebt
Und über unsere Liebe wacht

Irgendwann ist es vorbei
Und im Himmel wird Platz für uns zwei
Doch Dein Stern bleibt oben für immer und ewig stehn
Und auch noch in 1000 Jahren
Wird er deinen Namen tragen
Und immer noch der schönste von allen sein

Einen Stern, der deinen Namen trägt
Hoch am Himmelszelt
Den schenk ich Dir heut' Nacht
Einen Stern, der deinen Namen trägt
Alle Zeiten überlebt
Und über unsere Liebe wacht

Fünf, Vier, Drei, Zwo, Eins, Zero

Einen Stern, der deinen Namen trägt
Hoch am Himmelszelt
Den schenk ich Dir heut' Nacht (Einen Stern)
Einen Stern, der deinen Namen trägt
Alle Zeiten überlebt
Und über unsere Liebe wacht

So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow

Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I'll give it a chance
Now take my hand, stop, put Van The Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance

Say: Boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love shape of dance
I'm in love
dance
I'm in love
I'm in love in the shape of...

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new

I'm in love with the shape of you
I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love shape of dance
I'm in love

I' m in love in the shape of...

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate

We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play

Say: Boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in lo-lo-love
I'm in love shape of

Fonsi, DY
Oh, oh no, oh no (ey)
Hey, yeah, diri-diri-diriridi, Daddy, go!

Sí, sabes que ya llevo un rato mirándote
Tengo que bailar contigo hoy (DY)
Vi que tu mirada ya estaba llamándome
Muéstrame el camino, que yo voy (oh)

Tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Sólo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso (oh, yeah)

Ya, ya me estás gustando más de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro

Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo

Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmar las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito (sube, sube, sube)
Sube, sube (oh)

Quiero ver bailar tu pelo, quiero ser tu ritmo
Que le enseñes a mi boca tus lugares favoritos
(Favoritos, favoritos, baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro
Hasta provocar tus gritos y que olvides tu apellido

Si te pido un beso, ven, dámelo
Yo sé que estás pensándolo
Llevo tiempo intentándolo
Mami, esto es dando y dándolo

Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace ""bam-bam""
Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi ""bam-bam""

Ven, prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empezamos lento, después salvaje

Pasito a pasito, suave, suavecito
Nos vamos pegando poquito a poquito
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza

Pasito a pasito, suave, suavecito
Nos vamos pegando poquito a poquito
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas
Pero pa' montarlo, aquí tengo la pieza, oye

Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo

Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmar las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito (sube, sube, sube)
Sube, sube (oh)

Quiero ver bailar tu pelo, quiero ser tu ritmo
Que le enseñes a mi boca tus lugares favoritos
(Favoritos, favoritos, baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro
Hasta provocar tus gritos y que olvides tu apellido

Despacito
Vamo' a hacerlo en una playa en Puerto Rico
Hasta que las olas griten: ""¡Ay, Bendito!""
Para que mi sello se quede contigo (báilalo)

Pasito a pasito, suave, suavecito
Nos vamos pegando poquito a poquito
Que le enseñes a mi boca tus lugares favoritos
(Favoritos, favoritos, baby)

Pasito a pasito, suave, suavecito
Nos vamos pegando poquito a poquito
Hasta provocar tus gritos y que olvides tu apellido
Despacito"

I see rainbows in the skies.
Baby when you're close to me
I know you are ma cherie.

We are gonna dance into the sea
All I want is you - you're ma cherie
Never seen a girl that 's so jolie
All I want is you - you're ma cherie

Ma cherie,

Take my hand and come with me.

We don 't need to run or hide
I'll be there to hold you tight
You and me, we are on fire
Ma cherie, you're my desire

We are gonna dance into the sea
All I want is you - you're ma cherie
Never seen a girl that 's so jolie
All I want is you - you're ma cherie

I will take you higher x4

You 're my love, you 're ma cherie."
5,Adele,Rolling In The Deep,30.01.2011,93,1,6588,/song/Adele/Rolling-In-The-Deep-767937,"There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bring me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare

See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bring me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hands
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there as mine sure won't be shared

The scars of your love remind me of us
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
I can't help feeling
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hands
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hands
But you played it with a beating

Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could have had it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all, it all, it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hands
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hands
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
But you played it
You played it
You played it
You played it to the beat."

Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
You've got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
What's going on in that beautiful mind
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright

My head's under water
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh oh

How many times do I have to tell you
Even when you're crying you're beautiful too
The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head for you

My head's under water
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh oh

Give me all of you
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Risking it all, though it's hard

'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you

I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh oh"
7,Amy Macdonald,This Is The Life,23.03.2008,94,2,6125,/song/Amy-Macdonald/This-Is-The-Life-349688,"Oh the wind whistles down
The cold dark street tonight
And the people they were dancing to the music vibe
And the boys chase the girls with the curls in their hair

While the shy tormented youth sit way over there
And the songs they get louder

Each one better than before

And you're singing the songs
Thinking this is the life
And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?
Where you gonna sleep tonight?

And you're singing the songs
Thinking this is the life

And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?
Where you gonna sleep tonight?
Where you gonna sleep tonight?
So you're heading down the road in your taxi for four
And you're waiting outside Jimmy's front door
But nobody's in and nobody's home 'til four
So you're sitting there with nothing to do
Talking about Robert Riger and his motley crew
And where you're gonna go and where you're gonna sleep tonight
And you're singing the songs
Thinking this is the life
And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?
Where you gonna sleep tonight?
And you're singing the songs
Thinking this is the life
And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?
Where you gonna sleep tonight?
Where you gonna sleep tonight?
And you're singing the songs
Thinking this is the life
And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?
Where you gonna sleep tonight?
And you're singing the songs
Thinking this is the life
And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?
Where you gonna sleep tonight?
And you're singing the songs
Thinking this is the life
And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?
Where you gonna sleep tonight?
And you're singing the songs
Thinking this is the life
And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?
Where you gonna sleep tonight?
Where you gonna sleep tonight?"

Küsse auf der Haut, so wie ein Liebes-Tattoo, oho, oho.
Was das zwischen uns auch ist, Bilder die man nie vergisst
Und dein Blick hat mir gezeigt, das ist unsre' Zeit

Atemlos durch die Nacht
Bis ein neuer Tag erwacht
Atemlos einfach raus
Deine Augen zieh'n mich aus!

Spür' was Liebe mit uns macht

Wir sind heute ewig, tausend Glücksgefühle
Alles was ich bin, teil' ich mit Dir
Wir sind unzertrennlich, irgendwie unsterblich
Komm nimm' meine Hand und geh' mit mir

Komm wir steigen auf das höchste Dach dieser Welt
Halten einfach fest was uns zusammen hält, oho, oho
Bist du richtig süchtig, Haut an Haut ganz berauscht
Fall in meine Arme und der Fallschirm geht auf, oho, oho.
Alles was ich will, ist da, große Freiheit pur, ganz nah
Nein wir wollen hier nicht weg, alles ist perfekt

To make ends meet

On every street
It feels alright
But never complete
Without joy

Undo it
It takes two

Even the coldest days
You're moments ago
But seconds away

It's true but
It's a cruel world

We can play it safe
Or play it cool
Follow the leader
Or make up all the rules

The choice is yours
So choose

That you found a girl
And you're married now (ow ow)

Guess she gave you things
I didn't give to you ooh ooh
Old friend why are you so shy I
Ain't like you to hold back
Or hide from the light
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but
I couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over
Never mind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too!
Don't forget me I beg I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah
You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised
In a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but
I couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over yet
Never mind I find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too!
Don't forget me I beg I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead yeah
Nothing compares
No worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes they're memories made
Who would have known how bitter-sweet this would taste
Never mind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too!
Don't forget me I beg I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead
Never mind I'll find someone like you

So lost, I'm faded

These shallow waters never met
What I needed
I'm letting go
A deeper dive
Eternal silence of the sea
I'm breathing
Alive

Where are you now?

Under the bright
But faded lights
You set my heart on fire

Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go

Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow, and they go so fast

You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow, and it goes so fast

Well, you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much, and you dived too deep

Well, you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

30,Hozier,Take Me To Church,28.09.2014,68,1,4858,/song/Hozier/Take-Me-To-Church-1200169,"My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak

She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's gettin' more bleak
A fresh poison each week
We were born sick
You heard them say it

My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, worship in the bedroom
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well
A-amen, amen, amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the Goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny

Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine-looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful

That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies

I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean
Oh, oh, amen, amen, amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life"

Cuando tú me miras, se me sube el corazón
(Me palpita lento el corazón)
Y en un silencio, tu mirada dice mil palabras
La noche en la que te suplico que no salga el sol

Bailando, bailando, bailando, bailando
Tu cuerpo y el mío llenando el vacío
Subiendo y bajando
Bailando, bailando, bailando, bailando
Ese fuego por dentro me va enloqueciendo
Me va saturando

Con tu física y tu química, también tu anatomía
La cerveza y el tequila, y tu boca con la mía
Ya no puedo más
Ya no puedo más

Con esta melodía, tu color, tu fantasía
Con tu filosofía mi cabeza está vacía
Y ya no puedo más
Ya no puedo más

Yo quiero estar contigo
Vivir contigo, bailar contigo
Tener contigo una noche loca
Ay, besar tu boca

Yo quiero estar contigo
Vivir contigo, bailar contigo
Tener contigo una noche loca
Con tremenda nota

Tú me miras y me llevas a otra dimensión
(Estoy en otra dimensión)
Tus latidos aceleran a mi corazón
Qué ironía del destino no poder tocarte
Abrazarte y sentir la magia de tu olor

Bailando, bailando, bailando, bailando
Tu cuerpo y el mío llenando el vacío
Subiendo y bajando
Bailando, bailando, bailando, bailando
Ese fuego por dentro me va enloqueciendo
Me va saturando

And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?

And, darling, I will be loving you till we're 70
And, baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So, honey, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone, and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same

'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And, baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

That, baby, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la loud

So, baby, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh, darling, place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Then maybe we found love right where we are
Oh, baby, we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are"

Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons

If this is to end in fire
Then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night

Calling out father oh
Stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on
The mountain side

And if we should die tonight
Then we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time

Calling out father oh
Prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on
The mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire
Inside the mountain
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing souls
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

Oh, should my people fall
Then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls
We got too close to the flame

Calling out father oh
Hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on
The mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire
Inside the mountain
I see fire
Burning the trees
I see fire
Hollowing souls
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

And if the night is burning
I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns
Then my brothers will die
And as the sky is falling down
It crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground
I hear my people screaming out

Now I see fire
Inside the mountains
I see fire
Burning the trees
I see fire
Hollowing souls
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
I see fire (oh you know I saw a city burning out) (fire)
And I see fire (feel the heat upon my skin, yeah) (fire)
And I see fire (fire)
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountain side"

wieder neuem Platz zu schaffen
Mit gutem Gefühl
etwas Neues zuzulassen
In diesem Augenblick
bist du mir wieder nah
wie an jedem so geliebten vergangenen Tag
Es ist mein Wunsch
wieder Träume zu erlauben
ohne Reue nach vorn
in eine Zukunft zu schauen
Ich sehe einen Sinn

And down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change

An August summer night
Soldiers passing by
Listening to the wind of change

The world is closing in
And did you ever think
That we could be so close, like brothers

The future's in the air
I can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
In the wind of change

Walking down the street
And distant memories
Are buried in the past forever

I follow the Moskva
And down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
With you and me

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
In the wind of change

The wind of change blows straight
Into the face of time
Like a storm wind that will ring
The freedom bell for peace of mind
Let your balalaika sing
What my guitar wants to say

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
With you and me

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
In the wind of change"

Loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing
That I know.

And when it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive.

We keep this love in a photograph
We make these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen still.

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket
Of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer
Till our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home.

Loving can heal
Loving can mend your soul
And is the only thing
That I know (know)
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die.

We keep this love in a photograph
We make these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen still.

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket
Of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer
Till our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone.

And if you hurt me
Well that's okay baby only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go.

Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home.

Oh you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were 16
Next to your heartbeat
Where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul.

And if you hurt me
Well that's okay baby only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go.

When I'm away
I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost
Back on 6th street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come home."

This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby, do you recognize me?

Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
""Merry Christmas"" I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying ""I love you"", I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been

But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears

I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears

I'll give it to someone special

Oh oh baby
A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My god, I thought you were someone to rely on

Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore me apart
Oh oh now I've found a real love

You'll never fool me again
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears

I'll give it to someone special, special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart (I gave you mine)
A man under cover but you tore him apart
Maybe next year I'll give it to someone
I'll give it to someone special
Special

Es que yo sin ti y tú sin mí

Y yo sin ti no aguanto más
Por eso vengo a decirte lo que siento
Estoy sufriendo la soledad

Y aunque tu padre no aprobó esta relación
Yo sigo insistiendo a pedir perdón
Lo único que importa está en tu corazón

Yo te juré a ti este eterno amor
Y ahora otro te da calor
Cuando en las noches tienes frío

Yo sé que él te parece mejor
Pero yo estoy en tu corazón
Y por eso pido perdón

Es que yo sin ti y tú sin mí
Dime quién puede ser feliz
Esto no me gusta, esto no me gusta

Es que yo sin ti y tú sin mí
Dime quién puede ser feliz

And in the winter gets cold en vogue with your skin out,

Mommy took a bus trip and now she got her bust out,
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route,

And Jesus can't save you life starts when the church ends,
Came here for school, graduated to the high life,

Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead, long live the king""

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know St. Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Ohh...

una ilusion en tu pensamiento que te hace hacer cosas asi funciona el corazon.
Judy no por favor, go tell your man that he gotta go

To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons

You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won you can go ahead

Write it on the sky line

And my heart is broken

Falling for betrayal is worse

Building faith on love and words

And I got the magic wand
All these other girls are tempting
But I'm empty when you're gone

And they say
Do you need me?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do I make you feel like cheating?
I'm like no, not really 'cause

Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

She gives me love and affection
Baby, did I mention you're the only girl for me?
No, I don't need a next one

Mama loves you too
She thinks I made the right selection
Now all that's left to do is just for me to pop the question

Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her"

And the dreams that you dreamed of, once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
And the dreams that you dreamed of, dreams really do come true

Someday I'll wish upon a star,
wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melts like lemon drops, high above the chimney top
That's where you'll find me

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
And the dream that you dare to why, oh why can't I?

Well I see trees of green and red roses too
I watch them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

Well I see skies of blue, and I see clouds of white
And the brightness of day
I like the dark
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people passing by
I see friends shaking hands, singing ""How do you do""
They're really saying, I... I love you
I hear babies cry and I watch them grow,
They'll learn much more Than we'll know
And I think to myself What a wonderful world

Someday I'll wish upon a star,
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
High above the chimney top that's where you'll find me
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow way up high

No clouds in my storms
Let it rain, I hydroplane into fame
Comin' down like the Dow Jones

We Roc-A-Fellas
We fly higher than weather
And she flies it better

You know me, in anticipation for precipitation
Stack chips for the rainy day

Rihanna, where you at?

You had my heart, and we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines, but you'll still be my star
Baby 'cause in the dark, you can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you, I'll always share

Because when the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end

When the world has dealt its cards

Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
Time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen
But something happened for the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground
Found something true
And everyone's looking round thinking I'm going crazy

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

Trying hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that their goal is to keep me from falling
But nothing's greater than the risk
That comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy
Maybe, maybe

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

And it's draining all of me
Though they find it hard to believe
I'll be wearing these scars for everyone to see

I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That looked at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Take up my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Believer, believer
Believer, believer

Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

I was choking in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
'Til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like

Pain!

You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer

And we do this all day, welcome to St. Tropez

Woah, party now
Too much money in the bank account
Hands in the air make you scream and shout

Woah, party now
Spending money in a large amount
Hands in the air make you scream and shout
When we're in St. Tropez

Welcome to St. Tropez
Oh yeah

Get mad Henny, swimming and women
Imported linen, Egyptian cotton
The party just started, the party ain't stopin'
Keep shit poppin', poppin these bottles
Haters keep hatin', f*ckin' these models
So much money like we own the lotto
Pull up to a club in a white Murcielago
He don't make dollars, he don't make cents
He don't make you rich, he don't mean shit, shit

No heroes, villains, one to blame
While wilted roses fill the stage

Our debut was a masterpiece
But in the end for you and me
Oh, the show, it can't go on

We used to have it all, but now's our curtain call
So hold for the applause, oh
And wave out to the crowd, and take our final bow
Oh, it's our time to go, but at least we stole the show
At least we stole the show

Talking on his phone again
To someone who tells him that his balance is low
He's got nowhere to go
He's on his own again

Rock chick of the century
Is acting like she used to be
Dancing like there's no one there
Before she ever seemed to care
Now she wouldn't dare
It's so rock and roll to be alone

And they'll meet one day far away
And say, ""I wish I was something more""
And they'll meet one day far away
And say, ""I wish I knew you, I wish I knew you before""

Mrs. Black and White
She's never seen a shade of gray
Always something on her mind
Every single day
But now she's lost her way
And where does she go from here?

Mr. Multicultural
Sees all that one could see
He's living proof of someone
Very different to me
But now he wants to be free
Free so he can see

And they'll meet one day far away
And say, ""I wish I was something more""
And they'll meet one day far away
And say, ""I wish I knew you, I wish I knew you before""

He'll say, ""I wish I knew you
I wish I met you when time was still on my side""
She'll say, ""I wish I knew you
I wish I loved you before I was his bride""

And so they must depart
Too many more broken hearts
But I've seen that all before
In TV, books and film and more
And there's a happy ending
Every single day

And they'll meet one day far away
And say, ""I wish I was something more""
And they'll meet one day far away
And say, ""I wish I knew you, I wish I knew you before"""

Once more
You open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

Love can touch us one time
And last for a lifetime
And never let go till we're gone
Love was when I loved you
One true time I hold to
In my life we'll always go on

Near
Far
Wherever you are

The heart does go on
Once more
You open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

And I know that
My heart will go on

You were clapping in the nose bleeds

Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end
Always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough
You didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records
And then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough
You didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records
And then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

95,Katy Perry,Hot N Cold,09.11.2008,62,1,3922,/song/Katy-Perry/Hot-N-Cold-464160,"You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes
Yeah, you PMS like a bitch
I would know
And you over think
Always speak cryptically
I should know
That you're no good for me

Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in and you're out
You're up and you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

(You)
You don't really want to stay, no
(You)
But you don't really wanna go, oh
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in and you're out
You're up and you're down

We used to be
Just like twins, so in sync
The same energy
Now's a dead battery
Used to laugh about nothing
Now you're plain boring
I should know
That you're not gonna change

Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in and you're out
You're up and you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

(You)
You don't really want to stay, no
(You)
But you don't really want to go, oh
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in and you're out
You're up and you're down

Someone call the doctor
Got a case of a love bi-polar
Stuck on a roller coaster
Can't get off this ride
You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes

Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in and you're out
You're up and you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in and you're out
You're up and you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

(You)
You don't really want to stay, no
(You)
But you don't really want to go
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in and you're out
You're up and you're down"

in the club
its a new generation of party people
If you go hard, you gotta get on the floor
If you're a party freak then step on the floor
If you're an animal then tear up the floor
Break a sweat on the floor
Yeah we work on the floor
Don't stop, keep it moving

Put your drinks up!
Pick your body up and drop it on the floor
Let the rhythm change your world on the floor
You know we're running s**t tonight on the floor
Brazil, Morocco
London to Ibiza
Straight to L.A., New York
Vegas to Africa
Dance the night away

Live your life and stay young on the floor
...
Dance the night away
Grab somebody, drink a little more

La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor

I know you got it clap your hands on the floor
And keep on rockin', rock it up on the floor
If you're a criminal, kill it on the floor
Steal it quick on the floor, on the floor

Don't stop, keep it moving
Put your drinks up!
It's getting ill it's getting sick on the floor
We never quit, we never rest on the floor
If I ain't wrong we'll probably die on the floor

Brazil, Morocco
London to Ibiza
Straight to L.A., New York
Vegas to Africa

Dance the night away
Live your life and stay young on the floor
Dance the night way
Grab somebody, drink a little more

No fighting
We got the refugees up in here (no fighting)
No fighting
Shakira, Shakira

I never really knew that she could dance like this
She makes a man want to speak Spanish
¿Cómo se llama? (sí), bonita (sí)
Mi casa, su casa (Shakira, Shakira)

Oh, baby, when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad
So be wise (sí) and keep on (sí)
Reading the signs of my body

I'm on tonight, you know my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see, baby? This is perfection

Hey, girl, I can see your body moving
And it's driving me crazy
And I didn't have the slightest idea
Until I saw you dancing

And when you walk up on the dance floor
Nobody cannot ignore the way you move your body, girl
And everything's so unexpected
The way you right and left it
So you can keep on shaking it

I never really knew that she could dance like this
She makes a man want to speak Spanish
¿Cómo se llama? (sí), bonita (sí)
Mi casa, su casa (Shakira, Shakira)

Oh, baby, when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad
So be wise (sí) and keep on (sí)
Reading the signs of my body

I'm on tonight, you know my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel you, boy
Come on, let's go, real slow
Don't you see, baby? Así es perfecto

Baby, I know I'm on tonight, my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see, baby? This is perfection

Oh, boy, I can see your body moving
Half animal, half man
I don't, don't really know what I'm doing
But you seem to have a plan

My will and self-restraint
Have come to fail now, fail now
See, I'm doing what I can, but I can't, so you know
That's a bit too hard to explain

Baila en la calle de noche
Baila en la calle de día
Baila en la calle de noche
Baila en la calle de día

I never really knew that she could dance like this
She makes a man want to speak Spanish
¿Cómo se llama? (sí), bonita (sí)

Oh, baby, when you talk like that
You know you got me hypnotized
So be wise (sí) and keep on (sí)
Reading the signs of my body

Señorita, feel the conga
Let me see you move like you come from Colombia

Mira, en Barranquilla se baila así, say it!
En Barranquilla se baila así

Yeah, she's so sexy, every man's fantasy
A refugee like me back with the Fugees from a third world country
I go back like when Pac carried crates for Humpty Hump
We need a whole club dizzy
Why the CIA wanna watch us?
Colombians and Haitians
I ain't guilty, it's a musical transaction
Boo-boop-so-boop, no more do we snatch ropes
Refugees run the seas 'cause we own our own boats

I'm on tonight, my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel you, boy
Come on, let's go, real slow
Baby, like this is perfecto

Oh, you know I'm on tonight, my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
The attraction, the tension
Baby, like this is perfection

99,Justin Timberlake,Can't Stop The Feeling!,15.05.2016,62,1,3877,/song/Justin-Timberlake/Can't-Stop-The-Feeling!-1548555,"I got this feeling inside my bones
It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on
All through my city, all through my home
We're flying up, no ceiling, when we in our zone

I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good song in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
You gone like the way we rock it, so don't stop

Under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine
Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I should do to you
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing

I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance, come on

Ooh, it's something magical
It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushing on
I don't need no reason, don't need control
I fly so high, no ceiling, when I'm in my zone

Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good song in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
You gon' like the way we rock it, so don't stop

Under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine

Feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on

But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing

I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling
So keep dancing, come on

I can't stop the, I can't stop the
I can't stop the, I can't stop the
I can't stop the feeling

Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
(I can't stop the feeling)
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
(I can't stop the feeling)
All those things I should do to you
But you dance, dance, dance
(I can't stop the feeling)
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing

Everybody sing
(I can't stop the feeling)
Got this feeling in my body
(I can't stop the feeling)
Got this feeling in my body
(I can't stop the feeling)
Wanna see you move your body
(I can't stop the feeling)
Got this feeling in my body
Break it down
Got this feeling in my body
Can't stop the feeling
Got this feeling in my body, come on"

When you go down, when you go down down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down

Hey, walk out the house with my swagger
Hop in there with dough, I got places to go
People to see, time is precious
I look at my Cartier, outta control

Just like my mind where I'm goin'
No women, no shawties, no nothin' 'about clothes
No stoppin' now, my Pirellis on roll
I like my jewelry, that's always on whoa

I know the storm is comin'
My pockets keep tellin' me it's gonna shower
Call up my homies it's on
Then pop in the night 'cause this mix'll be ours

We keep a fade away shot 'cause we ballin'
It's Platinum Patrón every hour
Lil' mama, oh, you just like the flowers
Girl you the drink with all that goody power

You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down

From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwin' my money around
Ain't nothin' more beautiful to be found
It's goin' down down
From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwin' my money around
Ain't nothin' more beautiful to be found
It's goin' down down

Hey, shawty must know I'm the man
My money love her like a #1 fan
Don't open my mouth, let her talk to my fans
My Benjamin Frank-a-lin's

A couple of grands, I got rubber bands
My paper planes makin' her dance
Get dirty all night, that's part of my plan
We buildin' castles that's made out of sand

She's amazin', fire blazin'
Hotter than Cajun, girl won't you move a lil' closer
Time to get paid, it's maximum wage
That body belong on a poster

I'm in a daze, the bottom is wavin' at me
Like ""Damn it, I know ya""
You wanna shoot like a gun outta holster
Tell me whatever and I'll be your gopher

You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down

From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwin' my money around
Ain't nothin' more beautiful to be found
It's goin' down down
From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwin' my money around
Ain't nothin' more beautiful to be found
It's goin' down down

Yeah, I'm spendin' my money
I'm out of control
Somebody help me, she takin' my bank roll
But I'm king of the club
And I'm wearin' the crown
Poppin' these bottles, touchin' these models
Watchin' they asses go down down
Down down down down down down down...
Down down down down...
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down"
