7,17,168,31.54,"Race war started by Texas teacher A Texas fourth-grade teacher Karen Fitzgibbons published a racial Facebook post in which she confirmed that Black people are responsible for racial tensions in the USA.

""This makes me ANGRY! This officer should not have had to resign. I'm going to just go ahead and say it....the blacks are the ones causing the problems and this `racial tension. I  guess that's what happens when you flunk out of school and have no education. I'm sure their parents are just as guilty for not knowing what their kids were doing; or knew it and didn't care,"" she wrote. She also added,""I'm almost to the point of wanting them all segregated on one side of town so they can hurt each other and leave the innocent people alone.
